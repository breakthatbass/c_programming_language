This great text book goes through the entire C programming language and is written by the creators of the language.

The book isn't big; not counting the appendixes, it's only 188 pages so it's doable to go through the entire thing as a working adult. Many textbooks on programming can be up around 1,000+ pages. 

The purpose of me going through this as mainly a Python programmer is my experience with C thus far has stretched my abilities and made me a better programmer. Being self-taught, I felt that this book would be good for me as a learning and growing experience in the craft of computer programming.
