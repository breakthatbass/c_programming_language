# The C Programming Language ("k&r") 
## Second Edition
#### by Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie

This repo holds my answers to the exercises in the book. I have skipped some of the exercises but the majority of them are there. The files are named according to the exercise they pertain to except for a few, which are noted in the files.

If you see any problems in my soultions or want to do any of the exercises I skipped, do a pull request or raise an issue and I'll review it.

If you'd like to run the programs, download the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/breakthatbass/c_programming_language.git
```

There are no compiled executables in the repo but there are some makefiles for some of the larger programs. Otherwise, any of the files you wish to run would have to be individually compiled with something like ```gcc 4-1.c```
